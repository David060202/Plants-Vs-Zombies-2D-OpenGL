# Plants-Vs-Zombies-2D-OpenGL
A simple 2D implementation for the the Plants Vs Zombies

I have been using C++ and OpenGL to create a simplistic version of the game using simpler 2D shapes like rectangles, triangles and squares to define every part of the game.

To explain how the game works, the user has to collect stars(bonuses) which are being used to acquire turrets of different kinds and place them in the designated positions.
These turrets have to take down enemies which appear randomly from the right part of the screen. It has a drag and drop feature to manually place the turret in whichever 
position the player wants and also a life counter which depletes every time an enemy crosses the base situated on the left of the screen.

Take into consideration that is still a simpler version of the actual game and it doesn't have all the features of the real game.
